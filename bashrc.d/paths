# conda
# | for conda (miniconda3), it is not needed to run anything here.
# | Just run "/path/to/conda init" once, and it will modify the .bashrc automatically.
# | Do not move the conda automatic code snippet from .bashrc file to here, 
# | as upon dis-installation the program will automatically remove the snippet from the .bashrc file.
